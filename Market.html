<h1> The fickle market </h1>

<img src="market1.jpg" class="center" style="width: 340px; height:270px;">

<p>The purpose of this page is just to give you a tip for when you buy parts, if you're interested in getting
into computers and how to build them it is also important to learn the market you're buying into. Computer parts
are a fickle industry, what I mean by this is that from one day to the next parts can go on sale or raise their
price or there can suddenly be a shortage of parts altogether there are many reasons for all of this but I will
give 2 examples of what I mean.</p>

<p>Firstly memory for computers such as RAM and HDD or SSD are a commodity the reason for this is that these parts
or this hardware bases itself off of supply and demand especially in the world today where things like cloud storage
exist this means that for whatever reason prices or availability of certain hardware can fluctuate and if you can't
find something on one day or it's too expensive one day it might be worth waiting and seeing what the market does.</p>

<p>Secondly certain companies have close to monopolies on certain pieces of hardware such as AMD and Nvidia being
two big names in the graphics card industry this means that if something goes wrong with AMD and Nvidia the
marketplace for the graphics cards can be affected too, a good example of this is a couple of years ago Nvidia’s
factory in China caught Fire. The problem here is that this was one of Nvidia’s biggest factories and had a very
high output and it was out of commission for a few months this meant that Nvidia’s graphics cards soared in price
as there were very few of them to be sold and not a lot of them being made due to this factory burning. This is a
good example of how fickle the market can be, key players or random events can change the market day to day and so
therefore it is important to keep checking on the things you want and maybe wait if something seems too expensive
or not available at all.</P>
